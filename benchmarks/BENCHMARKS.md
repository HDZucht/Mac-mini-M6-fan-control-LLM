# Local LLM speed on a Mac mini M6 (32 GB)

Measured by Argus (Claude Opus 5.5) for Hans-Dieter Zucht on 3–4 October 2026. These are the runs that made the voltage regulators hot and led to the fan controller in this repository.

## Setup

- **Machine:** Mac mini M6 (Mac18,5), 32 GB unified memory, macOS 27.0.1, models on an external Thunderbolt SSD.
- **Server:** LM Studio (OpenAI-compatible API), runtimes llama.cpp (GGUF), MLX and the Splash engine (speculative decoding with DFlash2 drafts).
- **Method:** `bench_speed.py`. Each model loaded alone with a 32,768-token context (MLX builds ignored the context setting and loaded 34k to 165k), reasoning off, `max_tokens` 600, `temperature` 0.7, 3 runs per prompt, value = median decode speed in tokens per second.
- **Prompts:** two German explanations (Rhine geology, bead-based immunoassay), one English (Ruhr area economy), one Python function, one JSON extraction. The JSON answer was correct in 3 of 3 runs for every model except where noted.
- **Fan:** Apple's automatic control; fanguard did not exist yet. Temperatures were not logged during these runs.

¹ JSON 0 of 3: the model reasons inside its answer and did not finish within 600 tokens.

## What the table shows

- **Four mixture-of-experts models with 3–4 B active parameters run at 42–53 tok/s whatever the text** (Nemotron 3.5 Lightning, Nemotron 3 Nano Omni, gpt-oss-20b, Gemma 4 26B-A4B), most likely limited by memory bandwidth. The MLX build of Qwen3.6-35B-A3B is faster at 63–69 tok/s.
- **Speculative decoding (Splash) pays off most on predictable text:** JSON and code run 2–3.5× faster than the same model without it. Prose runs at 0.8–1.7×: Qwen3.6 Splash is slower on German prose than its MLX build (0.8–0.9×) and slightly faster on English (1.1×), Ornith Splash is 1.4× its GGUF, Qwen3.8-27B Splash 1.4–1.7× its GGUF.
- **Dense 27B–31B models are slow on 32 GB:** 7–20 tok/s for prose. With Splash, Qwen3.8-27B reaches 45–68 tok/s on code and JSON.

## BAAI AREX-2 (dense 27B, Qwen3.8 fine-tune), 4 October 2026

The model behind the 94.9 °C reading in the main README. Agent-style runs with a PubMed search tool, thinking on (the model's chat template forces it).

| Engine | Decode tok/s |
|---|---|
| LM Studio, llama.cpp, GGUF Q4_K_M | 6.8–8.0 |
| Splash 1.2.0 standalone, same GGUF + Qwen3.8-27B DFlash2 draft (selected automatically) | **22–37** |

Splash recognises fine-tunes by architecture, so the Qwen3.8-27B draft speeds up AREX-2 three- to fivefold although it was trained for the base model.

## Limits

One machine, one session per model, three runs per cell; prose quality was not scored in this table. Speeds depend on LM Studio and runtime versions of October 2026.
